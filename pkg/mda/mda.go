// Package mda defines the Mandatum Delegation Assertion wire format.
//
// An assertion is one signed link in a delegation chain running from an
// authenticated human sponsor to the agent performing an action. The format
// is specified in docs/spec/delegation-assertion.md; this package is the
// normative Go representation of it and nothing more. Verification lives in
// package verify, so that the types can be depended on without pulling in a
// verifier, and so that a bug in verification cannot be masked by a type that
// quietly normalizes its input.
